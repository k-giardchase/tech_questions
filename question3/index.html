      <h3>Old Pine by Ben Howard</h3>
      <p>
        Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags,<br>
        I've come to know that memories<br>
        Were the best things you ever had<br>
        The summer shone beat down on bony backs<br>
        So far from home where the ocean stood<br>
        Down dust and pine cone tracks<br><br>

        We slept like dogs down by the fire side<br>
        Awoke to the fog all around us<br>
        The boom of summer time<br><br>

        We stood<br>
        Steady as the stars in the woods<br>
        So happy-hearted<br>
        And the warmth rang true inside these bones<br>
        As the old pine fell we sang<br>
        Just to bless the morning.<br><br>

        Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags,<br>
        I've come to know the friends around you<br>
        Are all you'll always have<br>
        Smoke in my lungs, or the echoed stone<br>
        Careless and young, free as the birds that fly<br>
        With weightless souls now.<br><br>

        We stood<br>
        Steady as the stars in the woods<br>
        So happy-hearted<br>
        And the warmth rang true inside these bones<br>
        We stood<br>
        Steady as the stars in the woods<br>
        So happy-hearted<br>
        And the warmth rang true inside these bones<br>
        As the old pine fell we sang<br>
        Just to bless the morning.<br><br>

        We grow, grow, steady as the morning<br>
        We grow, grow, older still<br>
        We grow, grow, happy as a new dawn<br>
        We grow, grow, older still<br>
        We grow, grow, steady as the flowers<br>
        We grow, grow, older still<br>
        We grow, grow, happy as a new dawn<br>
        We grow, grow, older still<br>
